This is the second game that I made using pygame, and in this game I havent used help, and done it myself with the help of google of Course, the game idea is brutally stolen from the android game called Color Sense, but its a good simple first game, so I thought I should try it. It's turned out fine. But am looking forward to more advanced games.
